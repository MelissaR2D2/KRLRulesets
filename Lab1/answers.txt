1. The assignment asks us to create a function for messages but an action for sending the SMS because actions in a Pico are intended to change or do something, whereas functions just retrieve or manipulate data. Therefore, an action is appropriate for sending the message, which is a POST request that updates data, and a function is appropriate for retrieving messages, which is just a GET request.
2. We introduced the secrets for the Twilio module by configuring the rule that uses the module rather than configuring the module directly because the module is intended for general use and reuse. If we configured the module directly, no other rulesets would be able to use the module with a different account. This way, the app ruleset can use the module with the account it needs, and other rulesets can use the module with their own accounts.
